#D3 Experiments
Attempts to get various bits of D3js working 
(includes skeleton files for handy boilerplate code)

* __Charts__ two force-directed charts on one page. Turns out you can just have two layouts and two .on() functions.
* __animatedBar__ trying to figure out the right way to build a graphical timer
